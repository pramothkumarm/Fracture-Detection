Overview
Welcome to the Fracture Detection project! This project leverages the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to identify fractures in medical images. Our primary aim is to assist radiologists and medical professionals in accurately and efficiently detecting fractures, enhancing diagnosis and treatment.

Features
Fracture Detection: Identifies and localizes fractures in X-ray images using the YOLO algorithm.
User-Friendly Interface: An integrated UI design that allows users to upload images and view detection results.
Real-Time Processing: Provides quick and accurate fracture detection, making it suitable for clinical use.
Model Accuracy: Trained on a comprehensive dataset to ensure high detection accuracy.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Python, Flask/Django
Machine Learning: YOLOv5, OpenCV
Database: SQL/NoSQL (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
